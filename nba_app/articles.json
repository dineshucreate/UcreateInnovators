            "content":"Durant left in the second quarter of Game 5 of the NBA Finals, a game Golden State went on to win against the Toronto Raptors 106-105. The Warriors All-Star forward was seen leaving the arena on crutches and in a walking boot.He got hurt on a dribble on the right wing , coming up lame on a crossover move and falling to the floor. He grabbed the back of his leg, appeared to grab below the calf and more toward the Achilles area, and needed help to limp to the bench area and more help to get back to the Warriors' locker room. Warriors forward Andre Iguodala was on Durant's left side as they made the long walk back to the room, with Myers and Stephen Curry in the group immediately behind them.He shouted an expletive as he left the floor, his frustration obvious. He was supposed to be one of the marquee free agents this summer. He may now end up exercising his $31.5 million option to stay with the Warriors, especially if he's going to be sidelined for an extended period. He's going to come back stronger though. That's the kind of fighter he is and I'm going to miss him, man. It's not the same being out there without him. Durant had been cleared by the Warriors’ medical staff after Game 4, and participated in both a practice session Sunday and a shootaround practice earlier Monday. The Warriors had said throughout his month-long absence that they did not want him back on the floor until he was right, for fear of this exact scenario -- Durant aggravating the injury and having no chance of returning this season."

The Warriors All-Star forward was seen leaving the arena on crutches and in a walking boot.He got hurt on a dribble on the right wing , coming up lame on a crossover move and falling to the floor. He grabbed the back of his leg, appeared to grab below the calf and more toward the Achilles area, and needed help to limp to the bench area and more help to get back to the Warriors' locker room. Warriors forward Andre Iguodala was on Durant's left side as they made the long walk back to the room, with Myers and Stephen Curry in the group immediately behind them.He shouted an expletive as he left the floor, his frustration obvious. He was supposed to be one of the marquee free agents this summer. He may now end up exercising his $31.5 million option to stay with the Warriors, especially if he's going to be sidelined for an extended period. He's going to come back stronger though. That's the kind of fighter he is and I'm going to miss him, man. It's not the same being out there without him. Durant had been cleared by the Warriors’ medical staff after Game 4, and participated in both a practice session Sunday and a shootaround practice earlier Monday. The Warriors had said throughout his month-long absence that they did not want him back on the floor until he was right, for fear of this exact scenario -- Durant aggravating the injury and having no chance of returning this season."
